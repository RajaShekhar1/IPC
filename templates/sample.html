    <h1>Take-An-App Demo</h1>
    <p class="lead">Scenarios below are preliminary demos of 5Star Applications and Docusign integrated through a web interface.  Each demo link below has it's own scenario to illustrate a specific use-case.  Since this is for demo purposes, only a sampling of user data is actually entered into the live application (the end user workflow will have an intermediate data-entry step), but the applicant and agent end-user signing experience is consistent with the production system.</p>

  <div class="row marketing">
    <h4>In-Person, identity with DL or Employee #</h4>
    <p>Enroll directly online; scenario is as if sitting with an agent in person and starting from blank slate.  Employee will need to have DL# or an "Employee #".  Agent doesn't sign until later.</p>
    <p><a class="btn btn-lg btn-success" href="{{directSignURL}}" role="button">Enroll in person...</a></p>
    
    <h4>Remote - Agent initiates email</h4>
    <p>Enroll by sending email invitation to employee - since email validated, employee's email access is itself validation and thus will not need a DL or Employee #.  Agent doesn't sign until later.</p>
    <p><a class="btn btn-lg btn-info" href="{{ url_for('sendApp')}}" role="button">Initiate email enrollment...</a></p>
