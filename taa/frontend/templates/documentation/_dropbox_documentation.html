<h3>FTPS Configuration</h3>
<p>
    To connect to our secure FTPS enrollment import drop box, you must have the following information:
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Your 5StarEnroll authentication token. This will be provided to you by a 5StarEnroll administrator.
        It is also displayed on your direct upload / test page at <a href="{{ request.base_url }}">{{ request.base_url }}</a></li>
        <li>An enrollment case token. This will be provided to you by a 5StarEnroll administrator or Case Agent.</li>
        <li>The address is: <strong>ftp.5starenroll.com</strong></li>
        <li>The user name and password used to access all 5StarEnroll sites. This will be provided by a 5StarEnroll administrator.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    Connect to the FTPS server using port 21. There will be a warning about the self-signed certificate that you may ignore.
    <br>
    <br>
    The server will ask for a username and password. Use your 5StarEnroll system username and password.

    <p>
    To transmit an enrollment file, first ensure the filename ends with the extension ".flat" for flat files or ".csv" (or “.txt”)
      for comma (or tab) delimited files, and that
      the contents conform to the specifications detailed below.
      Transmit the file to the FTP server using any standard FTPS client.
      </p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> The file may appear briefly on the remote listing, but
      do not expect to see previously uploaded files in the remote directory listing.
      <br>
      <strong>All files are expunged once processed.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      A single email notification will be sent confirming either successful processing or an error condition and
      the reason(s) for the error condition.
      The status email will be sent to the email address associated with your 5StarEnroll system account.
    </p>
