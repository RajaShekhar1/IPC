  <p>
  5StarEnroll supports importing enrollment data via a Comma or Tab-delimited import service.
    Authorized 3rd party integrators can upload
  correctly formatted files to our secure FTP drop box, and 5StarEnroll will process
    the file once it passes a validation check.

    Please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@5starenroll.com">support@5starenroll.com</a> if you have any questions.

  <h2>Delimited File Specification</h2>
  <p>
    The 5StarEnroll system accepts well-formed tab and comma-separated files consisting of UTF-8 encoded text characters.
    The first line of the file contains the headers, and each subsequent line represents an enrollment to be imported.
    <br>
    <br>
    Each field has a particular data type restrictions given in the tables below.
    <br>
    If a field is not listed as required, it does not need to be present in the headers or data rows.
    <br>
    <br>
    The 'user_token' and 'case_token' fields should be the same in each row.
  </p>
